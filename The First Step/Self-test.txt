  - Machine code is code that is readable by the computer and hence its contents dependent on the hardware of the computer
  - Source code is the entirity of the code that comprises the application 
  - Embedded software is software that comes bundled together with the device
  - Java byte code is the output of the compliation process by the java complier and will then be run by the java virtual machine
  - Java virtual machine is a software that comes together with java and allows byte codes to be run on it producing similar results regardless of platform
  - An IDE is a software suite that includes syntax highlighting, builtin complier, and other useful utilities for programmers 
2 Once a file (.java extension) is ready for launch, we compile it. This process is done by the complier which checkes for compile time erros and, on success, generates a .class file(the byte code) this can then be run with the JVM
3 For single line comments we use "//" (without the quotation marks) for multiline comments we can use "/*" for the beginning, "*" for every line(optional), and  "*/" for the last line 
4 System.out.println() adds a new line at the end while System.out.print() does not. Also System.out.println() clears the buffer making sure everything is printed(Core Java Volume I)
